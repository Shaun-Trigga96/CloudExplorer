# Cloud Computing Models

## **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**

- Provides fundamental computing resources (e.g., servers, storage, networking). The customer manages operating systems, applications, and data.

## **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**

- Offers a platform for developing, testing, and running applications (e.g., databases, programming languages). The customer manages applications and data.

## **Software as a Service (SaaS)**

- Delivers applications over the internet (e.g., email, CRM, ERP). The customer manages user data.

## **Shared Responsibility Model**

### **Cloud Provider: Responsible for security of the cloud, including:**

- Physical security of data centers
- Network security
- Operating system security
- Regular patching and updates

### **Customer: Responsible for security in the cloud, including**

- Data security
- Application security
- Identity and access management
- Network configuration

### **Key Considerations for Shared Responsibility**

- ***Data Security***: Implement robust data encryption, access controls, and data backup strategies.
- ***Application Security***: Follow best practices for application development, testing, and deployment.
- ***Identity and Access Management***: Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- ***Network Configuration***: Configure firewalls, VPNs, and other network security controls.
- ***Compliance***: Ensure compliance with relevant industry regulations and standards.

# Fundamental Cloud Concepts

![icon:cloud_generic]

## **What is the Cloud?**

- The cloud is a metaphor for the network of data centers which store and compute information thatâ€™s available through the internet.

## **Cloud Computing Definition**

- Delivery of computing services over the internet, such as storage, servers, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence.
- Pay-as-you-go model, eliminating the need for upfront capital investments.

## **Cloud Deployment Models**

- ***On-premises Cloud***: Are hosted on-site, located and operated within an organization's data center to serve their unique needs. Traditional way of managing IT infrastructure.
- ***Public Cloud***: Owned and operated by a third-party provider. Multi-tenant cloud infrastructure.
- ***Private Cloud***: Dedicated to a single organization, often managed on-premises.
- ***Hybrid Cloud***: Combines public and private cloud environments.
- ***Multicloud Cloud***: Architectures that combine at least two public cloud providers.

## **Cloud Service Models**

- ***Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)***: Provides fundamental computing resources (e.g., servers, storage, networking).
- ***Platform as a Service (PaaS)***: Offers a platform for developing, testing, and running applications (e.g., databases, programming languages).
- ***Software as a Service (SaaS)***: Delivers applications over the internet (e.g., email, CRM, ERP).

## **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) in Cloud Computing**

TCO is a comprehensive financial analysis that calculates the total cost of a product or service over its lifetime. In the context of cloud computing, it involves evaluating both direct and indirect costs associated with adopting and maintaining cloud-based solutions.

## **Direct Costs**

- ***Subscription Fees***: Monthly or annual charges for cloud services.
- ***Data Transfer Costs***: Fees for transferring data in and out of the cloud.
- ***Storage Costs***: Charges for storing data in the cloud.
- ***Compute Costs***: Fees for using virtual machines, servers, and other computing resources.

## **Indirect Costs**

- ***Personnel Costs***: Salaries, benefits, and training expenses for IT staff managing cloud environments.
- ***Infrastructure Costs***: Costs associated with on-premises infrastructure that may still be required, such as network equipment.
- ***Security Costs***: Expenses for implementing and maintaining security measures in the cloud.
- ***Compliance Costs***: Costs related to adhering to industry regulations and standards.
- ***Vendor Management Costs***: Expenses for managing relationships with cloud service providers.

## **Factors Affecting TCO**

- ***Cloud Service Model***: The choice of IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS can significantly impact costs.
- ***Cloud Deployment Model***: Public, private, or hybrid clouds can have different pricing structures.
- ***Usage Patterns***: The amount and frequency of resource usage can affect costs.
- ***Vendor Pricing***: Different cloud providers offer varying pricing models and discounts.
- ***Hidden Costs***: Unexpected costs, such as data egress fees or support charges, can arise.

## **TCO Analysis Benefits**

- ***Cost Optimization***: Identifying opportunities to reduce costs and optimize cloud usage.
- ***Informed Decision-Making***: Making data-driven decisions about cloud investments.
- ***Risk Mitigation***: Assessing potential risks and costs associated with cloud adoption.
- ***Compliance Adherence***: Ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

## **Cloud Benefits**

- ***Scalability***: Easily adjust resources based on demand.
- ***Cost-effectiveness***: Pay only for what you use.
- ***Flexibility***: Access resources from anywhere with an internet connection.
- ***Reliability***: High availability and redundancy.
- ***Security***: Robust security measures provided by cloud providers.

## **Cloud Migration Strategies**

- ***Lift and Shift***: Moving applications as-is to the cloud.
- ***Re-platforming***: Modernizing applications for the cloud.
- ***Re-architecting***: Designing new applications specifically for the cloud.

## **Cloud Governance**

- Establishing policies, standards, and processes to manage cloud resources effectively.
- Ensuring compliance with regulations and security requirements.

## Overview of Cloud Computing

### What is Cloud Computing?

- The term "cloud computing" was created by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
- Cloud computing is a way of using information technology (IT) with five key traits:
  1. **On-Demand Self-Service**: Users can access computing resources (processing power, storage, network) as needed through a web interface without human intervention.
  2. **Broad Network Access**: Resources are accessible over the internet from anywhere with a connection.
  3. **Resource Pooling**: Providers have a large pool of resources and allocate them to users, allowing for bulk purchasing and cost savings.
  4. **Elasticity**: Resources are flexible; users can scale up or down quickly based on their needs.
  5. **Measured Service**: Users pay only for what they use or reserve. If they stop using resources, they stop paying.

### Why is the Cloud Model Compelling Now?

- **Historical Context**:
  - **First Wave: Colocation**: Users rented physical space for financial efficiency instead of investing in data center real estate.
  - **Second Wave: Virtualized Data Centers**: Similar to private data centers and colocation facilities but with virtual devices (servers, CPUs, disks, load balancers, etc.). Enterprises maintain infrastructure but in a user-controlled and configured environment.
  - **Third Wave: Container-Based Architecture**: Google switched to this model for faster business operations. It involves automated, elastic cloud services and scalable data. Services automatically provision and configure the infrastructure for applications.

### Google Cloud's Vision

- Google Cloud offers third-wave cloud services to customers.
- Future companies will differentiate through technology, primarily software.
- High-quality data is essential for great software.
- Every company will eventually become a data company.

## Cloud Computing Models

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- **Definition**: Delivers on-demand infrastructure resources via the cloud, such as raw compute, storage, and network capabilities, organized virtually into resources similar to physical data centers.
- **Example**: Compute Engine (Google Cloud IaaS service).
- **Payment Model**: Customers pay for the resources they allocate ahead of time.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- **Definition**: Binds code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure needed by applications, allowing more focus on application logic.
- **Example**: App Engine (Google Cloud PaaS service).
- **Payment Model**: Customers pay for the resources they actually use.

### Evolution of Cloud Computing
